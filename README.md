This is the core EMG removal code related to the publication ["Continuous and discrete decoding of overt speech with scalp electroencephalography (EEG)"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ad8d0a/pdf). Please cite the following if you are able to make use of this code:

Craik, Alexander, Heather R. Dial, and Jose L. Contreras-Vidal. "Continuous and discrete decoding of overt speech with scalp electroencephalography (EEG)." Journal of Neural Engineering (2024).

This code relies on EEGlab and the reMAE toolbox (ReMAE: User-Friendly Toolbox for Removing Muscle Artifacts From EEG).
